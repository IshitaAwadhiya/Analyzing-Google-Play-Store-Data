# Analyzing-Google-Play-Store-Data

This project aims to analyze Google Play Store data to uncover insights into app trends, user preferences, and market dynamics. I perform data cleaning, exploration, and visualization here to understand the distribution of app categories, the relationship between reviews and ratings, and the popularity of apps based on installs. Advanced analysis includes clustering apps and examining patterns to provide actionable insights for developers and marketers. The project leverages Python libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn for data analysis and visualization.
